Description
Signal Ingestion & Normalization
 

Objective:
Establish the initial ingestion pipeline that supports real-time acquisition, validation, and normalization of neural signal streams (specifically EEG/IMU), enabling consistent internal handling across downstream modules (e.g., policy enforcement, routing control, anomaly detection).

Scope of Work:
1. Mock EEG Signal Stream Generator
Implement a configurable mock EEG signal generator that simulates real-world scenarios (sampling rates: 256–1024 Hz, 8–16 channels).

Support multiple waveform types: sine, Gaussian noise, spike artifacts.

Inject timestamp metadata, signal discontinuities, and synthetic artifacts to stress-test processing logic.

Output as a live data stream via WebSocket, shared memory, or UNIX socket.

2. Input Adapter for Real-Time EEG Ingestion
Develop a streaming input adapter that connects to the mock EEG source.

Handle connection initialization, reconnection logic, and packet dropout.

Buffer incoming data with low latency using ring-buffer or event queue architecture.

Validate structural integrity: timestamp alignment, channel count consistency, value ranges.

Include runtime statistics (buffer fill %, stream latency, dropped packets).

3. Signal Format Normalization
Normalize raw signal values into a consistent internal format:

Fixed channel layout

Standardized voltage amplitude range (e.g., µV normalization)

Time-synchronized batch chunks (e.g., fixed window 250ms)

Perform data type conversion, scaling, and optional filtering (e.g., baseline DC offset correction).

Output internal signal structure in JSON or protobuf format for downstream modules.

Ensure compatibility with future multi-modal extensions (e.g., ECoG, EMG).

Deliverables:
mock_eeg_stream.py: Simulated EEG stream server

ingestion_adapter.py: Real-time ingestion module

signal_normalizer.py: Signal preprocessing pipeline

Internal format schema (signal_frame_v1.json)

Basic unit tests and real-time diagnostics logger

Notes:
This module is not responsible for cognitive signal inference or downstream policy routing.

Must be modular to support live-to-disk switch in future testing.

Designed for extensibility across different input sources (e.g., OpenBCI, g.tec, lab streaming layer).
